# Algorithm Execution Time Analysis

This repository contains files designed for testing and analyzing the execution times of recursive and iterative algorithms. The primary focus is on two tests:

## Fibonacci Number Computation
- The first test incorporates the `chrono` library to measure the time taken for computing the n-th Fibonacci number.
- The results showed the iterative implementation was faster 

## Tower of Hanoi
- In the second test, modifications were made to the `main()` functions in both recursive and iterative versions of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm.
- the solution now is  solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 disks.
- Analyze the timings between the recursive and iterative implementations of the algorithm.

These tests provide valuable insights into the efficiency of these algorithms, shedding light on their comparative performance across different scenarios. Feel free to explore the code and results within the repository for a deeper understanding of the execution dynamics. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!


This is commonly referred to as BENCHMARKING CODE which is the process of measuring/comparing performances between code or algorithms.
