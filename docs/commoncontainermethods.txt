Common Methods for Sequential Containers (e.g., vectors, lists):
push_back: Adds an element to the end.
pop_back: Removes the last element.
front: Returns a reference to the first element.
back: Returns a reference to the last element.
begin, end: Returns iterators pointing to the beginning and end.
empty: Checks if the container is empty.
size: Returns the number of elements.
clear: Removes all elements.


Common Methods for Trees (e.g., binary trees):
insert: Inserts an element into the tree.
remove: Removes an element from the tree.
find: Finds an element in the tree.
traverse: Performs a traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) of the tree.


Common Methods for Queues:
push: Adds an element to the back.
pop: Removes the front element.
front: Returns a reference to the front element.
back: Returns a reference to the back element.
empty: Checks if the queue is empty.
size: Returns the number of elements.


Common Methods for Associative Containers (e.g., maps, sets):
insert: Inserts an element into the container.
erase: Removes an element from the container.
find: Finds an element in the container.
count: Counts the occurrences of a specific element.
begin, end: Returns iterators pointing to the beginning and end.


Common Methods for Lists:
insert: Inserts an element at a specific position.
erase: Removes an element at a specific position.
reverse: Reverses the order of elements.
sort: Sorts the elements.
